      <h2>Creativity &amp; Personal Development</h2>
      <h3>Keep your creative brain switched on</h3>
      <p>
        Creativity is not a hobby, it is a way to process the world.  
        Leon started Closer Lives with poetry, and the Creative Brain Workbook grew from that same need to turn ideas into something real.
      </p>

        Whether you write, draw, build online projects, or simply love language, the Closer Lives Poetry Collective is a low pressure space to share your words and be inspired by others.

    <!-- Digital Safety & Online Confidence -->
    <div class="cl-section" aria-label="Digital safety and online confidence resources">
      <h2>Digital Safety &amp; Online Confidence</h2>
      <h3>Protect your logins, accounts, and peace of mind</h3>
      <p>
        After seeing how many people lose access to Instagram and other platforms, we take digital safety seriously.  
        Using a VPN like NordVPN adds another layer of protection when you log in on public or shared networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are already dealing with an account restriction or deactivation, our Instagram Disabled Accounts Support &amp; Tips group gives you real stories and grounded advice, not quick fix promises.

    <div class="cl-section" aria-label="Remote work and nomad lifestyle tools">
      <h2>Remote Work &amp; Nomad Life</h2>
      <h3>Tools that support life between places</h3>
      <p>
        Full time travel or long spells abroad work best when your logistics are simple.  
        For medical and travel coverage, we use nomad friendly insurance like SafetyWing, and for phone connectivity we compare eSIMs so we stay online without chasing local SIM cards in every country.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are planning a long term lifestyle shift, resources like Trusted Housesitters can help you live in new places without paying full accommodation prices for every stay.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Compare eSIMs we have tested on the road in our Best eSIMs for Travel guide.</li>
        <li>Explore nomad insurance options that fit slow travel and flexible living.</li>

      <h3>Grow your platforms without losing yourself</h3>

        Our most read blog is about getting an Instagram account back after deactivation, which tells you how stressful this process feels for people.  
        We focus on practical steps, realistic timelines, and strategies that respect your mental health.
